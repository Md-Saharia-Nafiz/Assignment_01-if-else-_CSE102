# Assignment Title: Conditional Statement (if-else) Based Program







##  Description:
This is a simple C programming assignment that demonstrates the use of if-else conditional statements. The program takes input from the user and makes decisions based on that input using logical conditions. It helps beginners understand how a program can respond differently to different situations.

Through this assignment, students learn how to write decision-making logic, manage user input, and produce meaningful output. It also builds a foundation for understanding more complex programming concepts in the future.
## 💡Key Concepts Used:
(i) if, else if, and else statements

(ii) Logical comparison operators (e.g., ==, >, <, >=, <=)

(iii) User input and output using scanf() and printf()

(iv) Basic syntax and structure of a C program


## ✨ Features:
✅ User Input Handling – Takes input from the user through the keyboard.

🔍 Conditional Checking – Uses if, else if, and else to evaluate logical conditions.

🔄 Dynamic Output – Provides different outputs based on different inputs.

🧠 Decision Making – Demonstrates how a program makes decisions like humans using logic.

📚 Educational Purpose – Helps beginners understand the flow of control in C programming.

⚙️ Simple and Clean Code – Easy to read, modify, and learn for new programmers.
## 🔔 Purpose:
This assignment is designed to:

-> hance understanding of conditional statements in C

-> Practice basic problem-solving logic

-> Improve familiarity with syntax and structure
## 
##  What I Learned from This Assignment:
✅ Gained a clear understanding of conditional programming logic.

🧠 Learned how if, else if, and else statements work and how to evaluate multiple conditions.

💡 Practiced how to take user input and display different outputs based on the input.

🛠️ Learned how to break down a simple problem and convert it into code step-by-step.

👨‍💻 Improved my understanding of C programming syntax and structure.

📈 Enhanced my ability to think logically and make decisions in code — a skill useful for future projects.
